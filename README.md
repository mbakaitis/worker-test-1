# Cloudflare Workers Template

A minimal, production-shaped starting point for a Cloudflare Worker: one small Worker, tests that run in the real Workers runtime, separate non-production and production environments, and a documented release path.

This is a GitHub template repository. Create your own project from it, then add your application code. Nothing here deploys to Cloudflare until you deliberately turn deployment on.

## What you get

- A minimal Worker in [src/index.js](src/index.js) with an explicit `fetch` handler.
- Tests that execute in the Workers runtime locally through Miniflare, no Cloudflare account required.
- Contract tests that fail if non-production and production configuration get crossed.
- Separate `non-prod` and `production` Wrangler environments, with deployment disabled by default.
- A documented branch, promotion, and release workflow.
- An opt-in workflow that proposes upstream template updates as a reviewable pull request.

## Quickstart

1. **Create your repository.** Select **Use this template** on GitHub for a clean start, or **Fork** if you want automated upstream sync. The two paths differ in ways worth understanding first — see [Choosing how to start](docs/using-this-template.md#choosing-how-to-start).

2. **Clone it and install.** Clone the repository you just created, not this one.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-OWNER/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
   cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
   npm install
   ```

3. **Name your Workers.** Change the three `name` fields in [wrangler.jsonc](wrangler.jsonc) from `cloudflare-workers-template` to your own project slug, keeping the `-non-prod` and `-production` suffixes. Update `name` in [package.json](package.json) to match.

4. **Run it locally.** No Cloudflare account is needed.

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Confirm the guardrails still pass.** The contract tests check that your two environments are distinct.

   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

6. **Create the `develop` branch.** Feature work merges into `develop`; releases go out from `main`.

   ```sh
   git switch -c develop
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

7. **Turn on deployment when you are ready.** Configure the Cloudflare API token and account ID as secrets, set up the protected GitHub environments, then set the `DEPLOY_ENABLED` Actions variable to `true`. This flag does not deploy anything by itself — it only unblocks the deploy job for the *next* push to `develop` or `main`. See [Configure GitHub environments and secrets](docs/using-this-template.md#4-configure-github-environments-and-secrets) for the exact token permission and the full trigger sequence.

Steps 3, 6, and 7 have details that matter — bindings, secrets, branch protection, and environment isolation. Work through [Using this template](docs/using-this-template.md) before your first deployment.

## Everyday commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Run the Worker locally with Wrangler |
| `npm test` | Run the unit tests and the configuration contract tests |
| `npm run test:watch` | Re-run unit tests as you edit |
| `npm run lint` | Check JavaScript style |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Apply safe automatic style fixes, then review the diff |
| `npm run changeset` | Record the release impact of a change |
| `npm run deploy:non-prod` | Deploy the non-production Worker |
| `npm run deploy:production` | Deploy the production Worker |

Node.js 22 is the supported version. `.nvmrc` is the single source of truth — run `nvm use` if you manage Node with nvm — and `engines.node` plus every GitHub Actions workflow read from it.

Local development uses the top-level Wrangler configuration and never deploys a Worker. Keep production credentials out of local environment files.

## Deployment

Merges to `develop` deploy the non-production Worker; merges to `main` deploy production after an environment approval gate. Both are skipped until the GitHub Actions repository **variable** `DEPLOY_ENABLED` is set to `true`. That flag is not a secret — it is only the explicit opt-in, which keeps this template and unconfigured projects from ever contacting Cloudflare. The Cloudflare API token and account ID remain GitHub secrets.

You can also deploy from your machine with `npm run deploy:non-prod` or `npm run deploy:production`, but the reviewed GitHub Actions path is the intended route to production.

Do not connect a Worker to this repository through the Cloudflare dashboard's **Settings > Builds** ("Workers Builds" Git integration). That is a separate auto-deploy mechanism that bypasses this workflow's environment approvals and test gates. See [Do not also connect the repository in the Cloudflare dashboard](docs/using-this-template.md#do-not-also-connect-the-repository-in-the-cloudflare-dashboard).

## AI is already wired in

This template was built with AI assistance, and it ships ready for it. You do not have to use AI — every command works the same by hand — but if you do, the setup is done:

- **Instruction files** tell an assistant how to work here: [claude.md](claude.md) is the canonical maintenance guide, with matching entry points in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md). They carry a versioned contract, so changes in expectations are reviewable rather than silent.
- **MCP servers** for Cloudflare documentation and GitHub are declared in `.mcp.json` and `.vscode/mcp.json`, in both schema formats. An assistant can look up current Wrangler behavior instead of recalling a version that changed a year ago. Neither file contains a token.
- **Contract tests** in `test/contracts/` are what make this safe. Suggest pointing non-production at a production database and you get a failing test immediately, not a subtle bug discovered later.
- **Human gates** cover the rest: deployment stays off until you opt in, production requires approval, and Cloudflare credentials live in GitHub secrets that no local tool can read. Automation can open a pull request; it cannot ship to production.

Instructions guide an assistant; they cannot constrain one. That is why the promises that matter are tests and gates rather than prose. See [Using AI with this template](docs/using-ai.md) for the details, including how to adapt the instruction files to your own project.
